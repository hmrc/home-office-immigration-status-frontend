<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement for the Check Immigration Status service</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement explains how accessible this service is, what to do if you have difficulty using it, and how to report accessibility problems with the service.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This page only contains information about the Check Immigration Status service, available at <a href="https://admin.tax.service.gov.uk/check-immigration-status">https://admin.tax.service.gov.uk/check-immigration-status</a></p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using the service</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You can use the Check Immigration Status service to view a customer's immigration status, as given by the Home Office. You can also view whether the customer has no recourse to public funds, their immigration route, and details on their previous nationality and immigration statuses from the past six months.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The Check Immigration Status service is run by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, this means that you should be able to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using voice recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to the service with a screen reader (including most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and Narrator)</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">We've also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand. </p>
<p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible the service is</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">This service is <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">partially compliant</span> with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility problems:</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>The page title and heading does not change when switching between the 2 different "search by" pages, so the user has to check the page to see if the form element have changed to know they are on the correct screen.</li>
    <li>Keyboard focus does not move to the error summary. That will increase the time for keyboard users to reach the error links and for screen reader users to identify the error.</li>
    <li>Missing error styling will make it more difficult to know which date field needs to be changed.</li>
    <li>Speech recognition software users and people with motor impairments who rely on being able to paste information, can find it difficult to enter dates as the number of characters is restricted.</li>
    <li>It is hard for screen reader users to confidently know how questions are grouped together.</li>
    <li>Missing third party libraries will mean that the ‘enter the customer’s details’ page will not display correctly on different browsers.</li>
    <li>When users are taken to ‘enter the customer’s details, the keyboard focus is placed on the field that users want to change on the ‘match has not been found’ page. Focus placement that is not predictable can confuse and disorient screen reader and screen magnification users.</li>
    <li>People who rely on high contrast mode on Windows machines will not be able to identify the Government logos on the top and bottom of the pages.</li>
    <li>For people who rely on screen magnification on iOS devices the HMRC logo is clipped and not readable fully.</li>
    <li>Missing headings for separate sections of content can create problems with its understanding and the navigation on the page.</li>
</ul>
